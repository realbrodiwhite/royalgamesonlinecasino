# Project Title: sloticon
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The platform allows users to engage in various interactive games, providing a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience.

## Project Description

This project is all about creating an exciting experience for gaming enthusiasts (and securing a bag!). It features a variety of digital slot machine games like Egyptian Treasures and Rock Climber, where users can play, compete against the house, and enjoy interactive features. The platform is designed with performance, user engagement, and scalability in mind, making it perfect for both casual and competitive gamers.

## Features

- **Multiple Game Options**: Users can choose from a variety of games, including:
  - **Egyptian Treasures**: A slot game that immerses players in an ancient Egyptian theme with stunning graphics and sound effects. Players can win rewards by spinning the reels and matching symbols.
  - **Rock Climber**: A challenging game where players navigate through obstacles to reach the summit. Players can earn points based on their performance and speed.
- **User Accounts**: Players can create accounts to save their progress, track achievements, and compete on leaderboards.
- **Responsive Design**: The platform is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a smooth experience across all screen sizes.
- **Real-time Updates**: The application uses Sockets.io to provide real-time updates on game status and user interactions, enhancing the multiplayer experience.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You should see the homepage with links to the available games.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
